# What's SwiftBar you ask?

SwiftBar is a Roblox Studio plugin which is designed to replicate a spotlight search bar (as seen in MacOS and other operating systems), with more than just a search feature.

[Looking for general info?](https://github.com/Julpav/SwiftBar)

### Want to open SwiftBar?
```bash
  SHIFT + F
```
This shortcut is not currently adjustable.

### What's required of you
Creating for SwiftBar does not require ownership, but is **highly** recommended in order to actively test, debug and plan your command. 
Within your custom creation, you must **ALWAYS** follow the Roblox [Terms of Service](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846-Roblox-Terms-of-Use) and usage guidelines. This includes not promoting/using exploits/backdoors/malicious content, especially with harmful intent.

**The use of custom commands is at the users discretion. Any harmful effects as a result of a custom command is not SwiftBars rightful responsiblity to prevent against, neither the owner/creator and any other developers involved besides the original creator and user. This is at your own risk.**

# Create your command
Get started by making a copy of this Repository.

Name your Repository something unique! This isn't your command name.
The file **CommandModule.lua** is the file you'll need to share around for the user to install the command. You'll need to edit and change the module code in order for the command to work with your needs. 
### Keep in mind: Each command is executed through a server-side script. This means HTTP features should be accessible through the Plugin, though users may be requested to approve any HTTP links provided. 
### All installed commands will stay locally on the users client. This means that all the content provided through these commands should not interfer with Roblox itself (especially due to Roblox limitations). Curious on whether or not your command is compatible with Roblox? See the DevForum for more.

# Sharing your command
So you've finished your command? Awesome!
### Visit your command module on GitHub and copy the URL. This is what you'll use to share your command. You can share your command with any SwiftBar owner! You can find a collection/gallery of custom commands within [Julian's Discord](https://discord.gg/Hn3Z4negQZ)!
### Your GitHub username will be listed prior to command usage. Users on GitHub with custom commands may be blocked/blacklisted from installing commands for any means necessary. Don't believe you did anything wrong? Head into Julian's Discord to contact support.
